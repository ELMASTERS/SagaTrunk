	<paragraph title="A introduction to Saga...">
	Saga is a open source server project for Ragnarok Online 2. Currently the we’re developing it under closed source until the game is officially released. Saga Revised is a side branch of the current saga project which has been developed with the purpose to make it more user-friendly. In order to make it more user-friendly, most of the scripting as seen in the main saga project has been replaced by tabular data with some additional xml files to configure the behavior.

	To addition to cross-platform we support mono. Mono is a open source framework similar to Microsoft’s .net framework. As mono is still in development itself we cannot guarantee that we completely support  Linux but with companies such as Novell supporting the mono framework we are confident in its success.
